## Backstory
Maya joined the company 8 years ago as a senior developer and was promoted to manager 3 years ago. She manages a team of 12 developers across two time zones. She's known for her technical expertise but often feels caught between executive demands and team needs. She skips lunch most days to catch up on emails and has learned to be very efficient with her time. Her biggest win recently was delivering a major product feature on time despite resource constraints.

## What She Wants to Learn
Executive communication skills, how to influence upward, and delegation techniques.
