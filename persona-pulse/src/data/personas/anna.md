## Backstory
Anna was part of an acquisition 3 years ago when her startup was bought. Her original team of 8 has been slowly integrated, but they still feel like outsiders. She has deep expertise in network protocols that the main company lacks. She's tired of broken links and systems that don't work with her credentials. She's been promised "full integration" multiple times but it never fully happens.

## What She Wants to Learn
The company's internal processes and politics, and how to navigate a large organization.
